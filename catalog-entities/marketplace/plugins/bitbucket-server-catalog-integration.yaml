  description: |
    The Bitbucket Server integration has a special entity provider for discovering catalog files located in Bitbucket Server. The provider will search your Bitbucket Server account and register catalog files matching the configured path as Location entity and via following processing steps add all contained catalog entities. This can be useful as an alternative to static locations or manually adding things to the catalog.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, and configure plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details on the configuration required.
