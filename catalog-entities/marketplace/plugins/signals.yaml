    The Backstage Notifications System provides a way for plugins and external services to send notifications to Backstage users. 
    These notifications are displayed in the dedicated page of the Backstage frontend UI or by frontend plugins per specific scenarios. 
    Additionally, notifications can be sent to external channels (like email) via "processors" implemented within plugins.

    This plugin contains functionalities that help utilize the signals plugin. To get started, see installation instructions from 
    `@backstage/plugin-signals-node`, `@backstage/plugin-signals-backend`, and `@backstage/plugin-signals`.
    There are two ways to utilize the signals plugin; either by using the hook or by directly using the API.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub) 
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other 
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
