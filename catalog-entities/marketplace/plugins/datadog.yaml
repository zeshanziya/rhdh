    Embed Datadog graphs and dashboards into Backstage.

    Datadog is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services through a SaaS-based data analytics platform.
    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, and configure plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details on the configuration required.
