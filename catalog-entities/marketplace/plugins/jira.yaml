    The Jira Backstage plugin lets you bring the Jira project related to your service into the Catalog.
    You can keep track of tasks, stories, bugs, and epics from the service page in Backstage. 
    
    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub
    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub) 
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other 
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
