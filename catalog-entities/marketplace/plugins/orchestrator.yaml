    Orchestrator brings serverless workflows into Backstage, focusing on the journey for application 
    migration to the cloud, on boarding developers , and user-made workflows of Backstage actions 
    or external systems.

    The Orchestrator features two primary workflow categories:

    * Infrastructure workflows: focus on automating infrastructure-related tasks
    * Assessment workflows: focus on evaluating and analyzing data to suggest suitable infrastructure workflow options for subsequent execution

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub) 
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other 
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
