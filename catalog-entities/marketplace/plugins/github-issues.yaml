    Based on the [well-known GitHub slug annotation](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/well-known-annotations#githubcomproject-slug) associated with the Entity, it renders the list of Open issues in GitHub.
    The plugin will attempt to determine the source code location using the [well-known Source location slug annotation](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/well-known-annotations/#backstageiosource-location) or [Managed by location slug annotation](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/well-known-annotations/#backstageiomanaged-by-location) associated with the Entity.
    If no configured Github provider will match, the first one will be used.

    The plugin is designed to work with four Entity kinds, and it behaves a bit differently depending on that kind:

    - Kind: Group/User: plugin renders issues from all repositories for which the Entity is the owner.
    - Kind: API/Component: plugin renders issues from only one repository assigned to the Entity

    **Issues are sorted from the recently updated DESC order (the plugin might not render all issues from a single repo next to each other).**

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
