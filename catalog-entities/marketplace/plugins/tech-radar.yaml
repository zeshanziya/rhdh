    The Backstage integration for the Tech Radar based on Zalando's Tech Radar open sourced on GitHub.
    This plugin is used at Spotify for visualizing the official guidelines of different areas of software development
    such as languages, frameworks, infrastructure and processes.

    Zalando's description of TechRadar:

    > The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support engineering teams at Zalando to pick the best
    technologies for new projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in t
    echnologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously evolve our technology landscape.
    Based on the pioneering work of ThoughtWorks, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies
    that are interesting in software development — changes that we think our engineering teams should pay
    attention to and consider using in their projects.

    Technologies on the Radar are organized into four rings: Adopt, Trial, Assess, and Hold.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
