  description: |
    The Amazon ECS plugin for Backstage enables developers to view and monitor their Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
    resources directly within the Backstage developer portal. This integration provides a unified view of your ECS services,
    tasks, and deployments alongside your service catalog entities.

    ## Key Features

    * **Service Monitoring**: View real-time status of ECS services including running tasks, desired count, and deployment status
    * **Task Information**: Access detailed information about ECS tasks, including container status and health
    * **Flexible Discovery**: Find ECS services using either specific ARNs or tag-based queries
    * **AWS Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with AWS SDK credential chain for authentication
    * **Entity Annotations**: Link Backstage catalog entities to ECS services using simple annotations

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    This plugin consists of both frontend and backend components that work together to provide ECS integration.

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin

    The AWS ECS plugin requires AWS credentials to be configured. The backend plugin uses the AWS SDK credential chain,
    which supports multiple authentication methods including environment variables, IAM roles, and AWS profiles.

    ### Backend Configuration

    Configure AWS credentials via environment variables:

    ```bash
    AWS_REGION=us-east-1
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
    ```

    For production deployments, using IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) or EC2 instance profiles is recommended
    for better security.

    ### Entity Annotations

    Add ECS service information to your catalog entities using annotations:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Component
    metadata:
      name: my-service
      annotations:
        # Option 1: Specific service ARN
        aws.amazon.com/amazon-ecs-service-arn: arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:service/my-cluster/my-service

        # Option 2: Tag-based discovery
        # aws.amazon.com/amazon-ecs-service-tags: component=my-app,environment=production
    spec:
      type: service
      lifecycle: production
      owner: platform-team
    ```

    The frontend plugin will automatically display an "Amazon ECS" tab on catalog entities with these annotations,
    showing the associated ECS service information.

    ## Prerequisites

    * AWS account with ECS services
    * AWS credentials configured with appropriate IAM permissions
    * IAM permissions required:
      * `ecs:DescribeServices`
      * `ecs:DescribeTasks`
      * `ecs:ListTasks`
      * Additional permissions may be required based on your configuration

    For more detailed configuration instructions, see the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/awslabs/backstage-plugins-for-aws/blob/main/plugins/ecs/README.md).
