    View Security Insights for your components in Backstage (requires GitHub advanced security).
    This plugin requires features provided by GitHub advanced security. Specifically, it calls the code-scanning endpoints. 
    Advanced security is free for public repos but not for private repos even on GitHub Enterprise plans. It must be purchased separately.
    You can check if you have Advanced Security enabled by navigating to your repo in GitHub and checking under 
    Security -> Overview -> “Code scanning alerts”.

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub) 
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other 
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
