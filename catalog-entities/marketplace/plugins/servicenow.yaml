  title: ServiceNow Integration for Red Hat Developer Hub
  description: |
    The ServiceNow plugin integrates ServiceNow incidents directly into Red Hat Developer Hub. 
    It displays incidents associated with the currently logged in user, such as those where 
    they are the caller, assignee, or reporter, as well as incidents linked to the current 
    catalog entity. This enables faster visibility into relevant issues and improves 
    operational awareness.

    The ServiceNow plugin brings incident visibility from your ServiceNow instance into the 
    Red Hat Developer Hub. It allows users to view incidents associated with the logged in user, 
    whether they are the caller, assignee, or reporter, as well as incidents linked to the 
    current catalog entity. This enables seamless access to operational data and helps accelerate 
    issue resolution.


    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuration

    The plugin requires your ServiceNow instance URL and authentication details (such as Basic Auth or OAuth).
    You can optionally filter incidents by user fields like `caller_id`, `assigned_to`, or `opened_by`.

    For detailed setup of both frontend and backend components, refer to the [ServiceNow plugin documentation](https://github.com/backstage/community-plugins/tree/main/workspaces/servicenow).
