    The TODO Plugin helps development teams track and manage TODO comments across their source code repositories.
    It automatically scans source code and displays TODO and FIXME comments in a centralized view within Backstage.

    ## Features

    - **Multi-language Support**: Scans TODO comments in multiple programming languages via the Leasot parser
    - **Entity Integration**: Displays TODO items directly on entity pages for easy access
    - **Customizable Tags**: Supports TODO and FIXME tags by default, with the ability to add custom tags (NOTE, XXX, HACK)
    - **Automatic Discovery**: Integrates with Backstage's software catalog to automatically scan repositories with `backstage.io/source-location` annotations
    - **Author References**: Recognizes and displays author information from TODO comments

    ## Use Cases

    - Track technical debt across your codebase
    - Monitor outstanding development tasks during code reviews
    - Identify areas requiring follow-up work
    - Maintain visibility of temporary workarounds and fixes

    ## How It Works

    The backend plugin determines which source code to scan by reading entity annotations from the catalog:
    - First checks the `backstage.io/source-location` annotation on the entity
    - Falls back to the `backstage.io/managed-by-location` annotation if source-location is not set
    - Only `url` locations are supported (locally configured `file` locations won't work)
    - Dot-files and dot-folders are automatically ignored during scanning

    ## Components

    This plugin consists of two packages:
    - **Frontend Plugin** (`@backstage-community/plugin-todo`): Provides UI components to display TODO items
    - **Backend Plugin** (`@backstage-community/plugin-todo-backend`): Scans repositories and extracts TODO comments

    Both plugins must be installed together for full functionality.
