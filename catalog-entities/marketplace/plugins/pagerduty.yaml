    Bring the power of PagerDuty to Backstage, reduce cognitive load, improve service visibility and enforce incident management best practices.

    [PagerDuty](https://pagerduty.github.io/backstage-plugin-docs/index.html) is transforming critical work for modern business. 
    Our powerful and unique platform makes sure you can 
    take the right action, when seconds matter. From developers and reliability engineers to customer success, security 
    and the C-suite, we empower teams with the time and efficiency to build the future.

    The plugin was initially started by Backstage and then transitioned into PagerDuty. 
    
    The plugin currently offers a PagerDuty card for:

    * Displaying relevant PagerDuty information about an entity within Bacsktage, such as active incidents or recent changes.
    * Quickly check who is on call for a service.
    * Trigger an incident to the currently on call responder(s) for a service.
    * Easily map PagerDuty Services to Backstage Entities.
    
    The scope for the plugin is quite limited at the time but we are working on bringing new features based on customer feedback. 

    ## Adding The Plugin To Red Hat Developer Hub

    See the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub) 
    for further instructions on how to add, enable, configure, and remove plugins in your instance.

    ## Configuring The Plugin ##

    Plugins often need additional configuration to work correctly - particularly those that integrate with other 
    systems. See the original source code repository, the software vendor, or the [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub)
    for further details regarding the configuration required.
