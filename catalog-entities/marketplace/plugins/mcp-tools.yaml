     # MCP Tool Plugins


     Red Hat Developer Hub provides a collection of MCP tools that can be used by AI assistants to interact with RHDH.


     Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standard for connecting AI models and applications (MCP clients) to external systems, enabling them to access information and workflows on those systems. MCP servers define tools which can be called by AI applications to access this data.
     RHDH supports running MCP tools through the mcp-actions-backend plugin available in Backstage.
    
     The MCP integrations in RHDH consist of two components:


     - **Backend MCP server** (`@backstage/plugin-mcp-actions-backend`): Provides the MCP server to run the MCP tools
     - **MCP Tool Plugins** (`@red-hat-developer/hub-backstage-plugin-software-catalog-mcp-tool` and `@red-hat-developer-hub/backstage-plugin-techdocs-mcp-tool`): Provides


     ### Key Features


     - **Client Integration**: Connect any compatible MCP client to RHDH to interact with the MCP tools
     - **Integrations with the Software Catalog**: Query the software catalog to fetch catalog entities, and important metadata associated with them
     - **Integrations with Techdocs**: Determine coverage of techdocs for catalog entities, and fetch the content of techdocs

     ## Installation


     ### Dynamic Plugin Installation for Red Hat Developer Hub


     Add the following configuration to your dynamic plugin yaml:


     ```yaml
     includes:
       - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
     plugins:
       # MCP server backend plugin
       - package: oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/backstage-plugin-mcp-actions-backend:bs_1.42.5__0.1.2!backstage-plugin-mcp-actions-backend
         disabled: false
      
       # MCP tools plugins
       - package: oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-software-catalog-mcp-tool:bs_1.42.5__0.2.3!red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-software-catalog-mcp-tool
         disabled: false
       - package: oci://ghcr.io/redhat-developer/rhdh-plugin-export-overlays/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-techdocs-mcp-tool:bs_1.42.5__0.3.0!red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-techdocs-mcp-tool
         disabled: false
     ```


     ## RHDH Configuration


     ### Complete Configuration Reference


     Register the MCP tools as a plugin source in your App Config:
     ```yaml
     backend:
       actions:
         pluginSources:
           - software-catalog-mcp-tool
           - techdocs-mcp-tool
     ```
    
     Configure a static token for the MCP server in your App Config, where `<MCP_TOKEN>` is some value specified by you:


     ```yaml
     backend: 
       auth:
         externalAccess:
           - type: static
             options:
               token: ${MCP_TOKEN}
               subject: mcp-clients
     ```


     ## MCP Client Configuration
    
     The MCP server in RHDH provides two endpoints that can be used by MCP clients:
    
       - Streamable HTTP: http://<RHDH_HOST>/api/mcp-actions/v1
       - SSE (Legacy): http://<RHDH_HOST>/api/mcp-actions/v1/sse


     Some MCP clients will require the Streamable HTTP endpoint, while others may require the legacy SSE endpoint.
     Consult your MCP client or AI application's documentation for how to configure MCP servers, and if a specific type of endpoint is required.


     Below we've provided a couple sample configurations for common MCP clients


     ### Cursor


     1) Navigate to Cursor Settings and select MCP Tools
     2) Select New MCP Server
     3) Paste the following configuration, where`<RHDH_HOST>` is the hostname for your RHDH instance, and <MCP_TOKEN> is the static token configured previously.


     ```
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "backstage-actions": {
           "url": "http://<RHDH_HOST>/api/mcp-actions/v1",
           "headers": {
             "Authorization": "Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>"
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```


     ### Continue


     Add the following to your agent's yaml configuration file, where`<RHDH_HOST>` is the hostname for your RHDH instance, and <MCP_TOKEN> is the static token configured previously.


     ```yaml
     mcpServers:
       - name: backstage-actions
         type: sse
         url: http://<RHDH_HOST>/api/mcp-actions/v1/sse
         requestOptions:
           headers:
             Authorization: "Bearer <MCP_TOKEN>"
     ```
    
     ## Local Development


     1. **Fork and clone this repository**:


         ```bash
         git clone https://github.com/your-username/rhdh-plugins.git
         cd rhdh-plugins/workspaces/mcp-integrations
         ```


     2. **Install dependencies**:
    
         ```bash
         yarn install
         ```


     3. Set `MCP_TOKEN` to some value (at least 8 characters):


        ```bash
        export MCP_TOKEN=<some-value>
        ```


     4. **Start the development server**:


         ```bash
         yarn dev
         ```


     5. **Configure your MCP client** to point to either:


         Streamable HTTP: http://localhost:7007/api/mcp-actions/v1
         SSE: http://localhost:7007/api/mcp-actions/v1/sse


         with the bearer token set to `MCP_TOKEN`.
