# Installing Plugins

To install a dynamic plugin, you need to add the plugin definition to the `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file.

The placement of `dynamic-plugins.yaml` depends on the deployment method.
For more information, see [Installing Dynamic Plugins with the Red Hat Developer Hub Operator](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.7/html/installing_and_viewing_plugins_in_red_hat_developer_hub/rhdh-installing-rhdh-plugins_title-plugins-rhdh-about#proc-config-dynamic-plugins-rhdh-operator_rhdh-installing-rhdh-plugins) or [Installing Dynamic Plugins Using the Helm Chart](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.7/html/installing_and_viewing_plugins_in_red_hat_developer_hub/rhdh-installing-rhdh-plugins_title-plugins-rhdh-about#con-install-dynamic-plugin-helm_rhdh-installing-rhdh-plugins).

Plugins are defined in the `plugins` array in the `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file. Each plugin is defined as an object with the following properties:

- `package`: The package definition of the plugin. This can be an OCI image, `tgz` archive, npm package, or a directory path. For OCI packages ONLY, the tag or digest can be replaced by the `{{inherit}}` tag to inherit the version from an included configuration. Additionally, when using single-plugin OCI images, the plugin path can also be omitted.
- `disabled`: A boolean value that determines whether the plugin is enabled or disabled.
- `integrity`: The integrity hash of the package. This is required for `tgz` archives and npm packages.
- `pluginConfig`: The configuration for the plugin. For backend plugins this is optional and can be used to pass configuration to the plugin. For frontend plugins this is required, see [Frontend Plugin Wiring](frontend-plugin-wiring.md) for more information on how to configure bindings and routes. This is a fragment of the `app-config.yaml` file. Anything that is added to this object will be merged into a `app-config.dynamic-plugins.yaml` file whose config can be merged with the main `app-config.yaml` config when launching RHDH.

Note: Duplicate plugins found across config files in the `includes` field will throw an error even if they are disabled. Similarly, duplicate plugin in the `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file will also throw the same error.

## Dynamic plugins included in the RHDH container image

The RHDH container image is preloaded with a variety of dynamic plugin packages, the majority of which are initially disabled, as they must be configued to work. The comprehensive list of these packages is at [`default.packages.yaml`](../../default.packages.yaml) file.

On application start, for each disabled package, the `install-dynamic-plugins` init container within the `redhat-developer-hub` pod's will log something like:

```console
======= Skipping disabled dynamic plugin oci://registry.access.redhat.com/rhdh/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment
```

To activate this plugin, simply add a package with the same name and adjust the `disabled` field.

```yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    package: oci://registry.access.redhat.com/rhdh/backstage-community-plugin-analytics-provider-segment:{{inherit}}
```

While the plugin's default configuration comes from the `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file, you still have the option to override it by incorporating a `pluginConfig` entry into the plugin configuration.

Note: The plugin's default configuration typically references environment variables, and it is essential to ensure that these variables are set in the Helm chart values or the Operator configuration.

## Using a Catalog Index Image for Default Plugin Configurations

RHDH supports loading default plugin configurations from an OCI container image. This feature allows you to maintain centralized plugin configurations that can be updated independently of the RHDH container image.

When the `CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGE` environment variable is set, the `install-dynamic-plugins` init container will:

1. Download and extract the specified OCI image
2. Look for a `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file within the image
3. Use this file as the primary source for default plugin configurations
4. Replace the embedded `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` if it's present in the `includes` list
5. Extract catalog entities from `catalog-entities/marketplace` directory (if present in the index image) to a configurable location

### Configuring the Catalog Index Image

The configuration method depends on your deployment approach:

- **Helm Chart**: See the [Helm Chart Catalog Index Configuration](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-chart/blob/main/docs/catalog-index-configuration.md) for details.

- **RHDH Operator**: See the [Operator Catalog Index Configuration](https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-operator/blob/main/docs/dynamic-plugins.md#catalog-index-configuration) for details.

### Catalog Index Image Structure

The catalog index OCI image should contain the following at the root level:

- A `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` file with the same structure as the embedded default configuration file
- Optionally, a `catalog-entities/marketplace` directory containing extension catalog entity definitions

```yaml
# Contents of dynamic-plugins.default.yaml in the OCI image
plugins:
  - package: '@backstage/plugin-catalog'
    disabled: true
    pluginConfig:
      # ... plugin configuration
  - package: oci://quay.io/example/plugin:v1.0!my-plugin
    disabled: true
```

### Catalog Entities Extraction

When the `CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGE` is set and the index image contains a `catalog-entities/marketplace` directory, the [`install-dynamic-plugins.py`](../../scripts/install-dynamic-plugins/install-dynamic-plugins.py) will automatically extract these catalog entities to a configurable location.

The extraction destination is governed by the `CATALOG_ENTITIES_EXTRACT_DIR` environment variable:

- If `CATALOG_ENTITIES_EXTRACT_DIR` is set, entities are extracted to `<CATALOG_ENTITIES_EXTRACT_DIR>/catalog-entities`
- If not set, it defaults to `/tmp/extensions/catalog-entities`

**Note:** If the catalog index image does not contain the `catalog-entities/extensions` directory, a warning will be printed but the extraction of `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` will still succeed.

### Using extra catalog index images

In addition to the primary `CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGE`, you can configure additional catalog index images using the `EXTRA_CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGES` environment variable. These extra images provide catalog entities that are made visible in the Extensions UI, but they do **not** contribute `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml` files (only the primary `CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGE` provides default plugin configurations).

The `EXTRA_CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGES` environment variable accepts a comma-separated list of entries. Each entry can be either a plain image reference or use the `name=<image_ref>` format to choose a simpler sub-directory name:

```
# Auto-derived subdirectory names
EXTRA_CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGES=quay.io/rhdh-community/plugin-catalog-index:1.10,quay.io/partner/catalog:latest

# Explicit subdirectory names
EXTRA_CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGES=community=quay.io/rhdh-community/plugin-catalog-index:1.10,partner=quay.io/partner/catalog:latest

# Mixed
EXTRA_CATALOG_INDEX_IMAGES=community=quay.io/rhdh-community/plugin-catalog-index:1.10,quay.io/partner/catalog:latest
```

Each image's catalog entities are extracted to a separate subdirectory under `<CATALOG_ENTITIES_EXTRACT_DIR>/extra/`, keeping them isolated from the primary catalog index entities:

- With explicit name: `community=quay.io/rhdh-community/plugin-catalog-index:1.10` will be extracted to `<CATALOG_ENTITIES_EXTRACT_DIR>/extra/community/catalog-entities`
- Without name: `quay.io/partner/catalog:latest` will be extracted to `<CATALOG_ENTITIES_EXTRACT_DIR>/extra/quay.io_partner_catalog_latest/catalog-entities` (derived by replacing `/`, `:`, and `@` with `_`)

If multiple entries map to the same subdirectory name, a warning is printed and the later entry overwrites the earlier one.

**Note:** Extra catalog index images only make plugins visible in the Extensions UI. They do not provide default plugin configurations or enable automatic plugin installation. To install plugins from extra catalog index images, users must add and configure them explicitly in their dynamic plugins configuration file.

## Installing External Dynamic Plugins

RHDH supports external dynamic plugins, which are plugins not included in the core RHDH distribution. These plugins can be installed or uninstalled without rebuilding the RHDH application; only a restart is required to apply the changes.

If your plugin is not already packaged as a dynamic plugin, you must package it into one of the supported formats before installation.

Dynamic plugins can be packaged in three formats:

- OCI image
- `tgz` archive
- npm package

You can also load the dynamic plugin from a plain directory, though this is not recommended for production use (expect for the plugins that are already included in the RHDH container image). But this method can be helpful for development and testing.

More information on packaging dynamic plugins can be found in the [Packaging Dynamic Plugins](packaging-dynamic-plugins.md).

### Loading a Plugin from an OCI Image

When defining the plugin packaged as an OCI image, use the `oci://` prefix, followed by the image name, tag OR digest, and plugin name separated by the `!` character (`oci://<image-name>:<tag>!<plugin-path>`).

```yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    package: oci://quay.io/example/image:v0.0.1!backstage-plugin-myplugin
```

For private registries, you can set the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable to the path of the configuration file containing the authentication details for the registry. This file is typically located at `~/.config/containers/auth.json` or `~/.docker/config.json`.

For integrity check one may use [image digests](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/descriptor.md#digests), making it possible to refer to the image digest in the dynamic plugin package:

```yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    package: oci://quay.io/example/image@sha256:28036abec4dffc714394e4ee433f16a59493db8017795049c831be41c02eb5dc!backstage-plugin-myplugin
```

#### OCI Package Plugin Path Auto-Detection

For OCI images containing a single plugin, the plugin path (the part after `!`) can be omitted and will be automatically detected from the image's metadata annotations.

Explicit Path Usage:

```yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    package: oci://quay.io/example/image:v1.0.0!backstage-plugin-myplugin
```

Auto-detected Path Usage:

```yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    package: oci://quay.io/example/image:v1.0.0
```

When the path is omitted, the installer will inspect the OCI image manifest for the `io.backstage.dynamic-packages` annotation and automatically extract the plugin path. This ONLY works for images containing a single plugin, please explicitly define the plugin path for multi-plugin images.

Images MUST be packaged with the `@red-hat-developer-hub/cli` to ensure the proper `io.backstage.dynamic-packages` annotation is applied.

#### OCI Package Version Inheritance

When working with OCI-packaged dynamic plugins, you may want to avoid specifying the version (tag or digest) in multiple places, especially when including plugins from other configuration files such as `dynamic-plugins.default.yaml`. Setting the tag of the OCI package to `{{inherit}}` allows a plugin configuration override to inherit the plugin version from an included configuration.

For example, if we have an included dynamic plugin file (`dynamic-plugins.example.yaml`) with `v0.0.2` of our plugin which might be updated to match the current RHDH version:

```yaml
# dynamic-plugins.example.yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: true
    package: oci://quay.io/example/image:v0.0.2!backstage-plugin-myplugin
```

and a `dynamic-plugins.yaml` file with the `{{inherit}}` tag using configurations for an older version that are still compatible:

```yaml
# dynamic-plugins.yaml
includes:
- dynamic-plugins.example.yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    package: oci://quay.io/example/image:{{inherit}}!backstage-plugin-myplugin
    pluginConfig:
      exampleName: "test"
```

The resolved version would be `v0.0.2`, but the overridden `pluginConfig` and `disabled: false` would still apply.

**General Notes:**

- An error will be thrown if you use `{{inherit}}` in the `includes` plugin configuration(s).
- An error will be thrown if `{{inherit}}` is used in `dynamic-plugins.yaml` when there is no existing matching plugin configuration key in the `includes` plugin configuration(s).
  - Plugin configuration key is a unique key based on the OCI image name + plugin path. Ex: `quay.io/example/image:!backstage-plugin-myplugin`

##### Combining Version Inheritance with Path Omission

When using `{{inherit}}` for version inheritance, you can also leverage the plugin path auto-detection feature by omitting the plugin path entirely. This is particularly useful when the base configuration in included files already has an explicit path or uses auto-detection itself.

For example, we can have an example plugin that uses auto-detection that will resolve to `oci://quay.io/example/image:v0.0.2!example-path`

```yaml
# dynamic-plugins.example.yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: true
    package: oci://quay.io/example/image:v0.0.2
```

Then we can just use `{{inherit}}` without a path, and we will inherit both the version `v0.0.2` and the plugin path `example-path`

```yaml
# dynamic-plugins.yaml
includes:
- dynamic-plugins.example.yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    package: oci://quay.io/example/image:{{inherit}}
    pluginConfig:
      exampleName: "test"
```

This only works when exactly ONE plugin from that OCI image is defined in the included configuration files. If more are found, an error will be thrown. Additionally, an error will be thrown if no matching plugins are found.

### Using a `tgz` Archive

When defining the plugin packaged as a `tgz` archive, use the URL of the archive and the integrity hash of the archive.

```yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    package: https://example.com/backstage-plugin-myplugin-1.0.0.tgz
    integrity: sha512-9WlbgEdadJNeQxdn1973r5E4kNFvnT9GjLD627GWgrhCaxjCmxqdNW08cj+Bf47mwAtZMt1Ttyo+ZhDRDj9PoA==
```

### Using an JavaScript package reference

When defining the plugin packaged as an npm package, use the package name and version, and the integrity hash of the package.

```yaml
plugins:
  - disabled: false
    package: @example/backstage-plugin-myplugin@1.0.0
    integrity: sha512-9WlbgEdadJNeQxdn1973r5E4kNFvnT9GjLD627GWgrhCaxjCmxqdNW08cj+Bf47mwAtZMt1Ttyo+ZhDRDj9PoA==
```

To get the integrity hash of a JavaScript package from the npm registry, use:

```bash
npm view --registry https://example.com:4873/ @backstage-community/plugin-todo-dynamic@0.2.40 dist.integrity
```

#### Using a custom NPM registry

To configure the NPM registry URL and authentication information, you can utilize a `.npmrc` file. When using OpenShift or Kubernetes, you can add this file by creating a secret with the `.npmrc` file content and mounting it into `install-dynamic-plugins` init container.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: dynamic-plugins-npmrc
type: Opaque
stringData:
  .npmrc: |
    registry=<registry-url>
    //<registry-url>:_authToken=<auth-token>
```

When using RHDH Helm Chart you can just name the Secret using following pattern `{{ .Release.Name }}-dynamic-plugins-npmrc`, and it will be mounted automatically. (If you installed RHDH using `helm install rhdh ....` than the secret should be named `rhdh-dynamic-plugins-npmrc`)

When using the Operator ....

### Storage of Dynamic Plugins

The directory where dynamic plugins are located is mounted as a volume to the `install-dynamic-plugins` init container and the `backstage-backend` container. The `install-dynamic-plugins` init container is responsible for downloading and extracting the plugins into this directory. Depending on the deployment method, the directory is mounted as an ephemeral or persistent volume. In the latter case, the volume can be shared between several Pods, and the plugins installation script is also responsible for downloading and extracting the plugins only once, avoiding conflicts.

**Important Note:** If `install-dynamic-plugins` init container was killed with SIGKILL signal, which may happen due to the following reasons:

- pod eviction (to free up node resources)
- pod deletion (if not terminated with SIGTERM within graceful period)
- node shutdown
- container runtime issues
- exceeding resource limits (OOM for example)

Then the script will not be able to remove the lock file, so the next time the pod starts, it will be be stuck waiting for the lock to release. You will see the following message in the logs for the init `install-dynamic-plugins` container:

```console
oc logs -n <namespace-name> -f backstage-<backstage-name>-<pod-suffix> -c install-dynamic-plugins
======= Waiting for lock release (file: /dynamic-plugins-root/install-dynamic-plugins.lock)...
```

In such a case, you can delete the lock file manually from any of the Pods:

```console
oc exec -n <namespace-name> deploy/backstage-<backstage-name> -c install-dynamic-plugins -- rm -f /dynamic-plugins-root/dynamic-plugins.lock
```
