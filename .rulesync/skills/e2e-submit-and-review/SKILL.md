# Submit and Review

Create a pull request for the E2E test fix, trigger automated review, address feedback, and verify CI passes.

## When to Use

Use this skill after verifying the fix (via `e2e-verify-fix`) when all tests pass and code quality checks are clean.

## Step 0: Resolve Pre-Commit Hooks

Before committing, ensure all related workspaces have their dependencies installed so pre-commit hooks (lint-staged, rulesync, etc.) pass:

```bash
# Root workspace
yarn install

# If e2e-tests files were changed
cd e2e-tests && yarn install && cd ..

# If .ci files were changed
cd .ci && yarn install && cd ..
```

If a pre-commit hook fails during commit, fix the issue and create a **new** commit — do not amend.

## Step 1: Commit Changes

### Stage and Commit

```bash
# Stage only relevant files
git add e2e-tests/
git add .ci/  # Only if deployment config was changed

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "fix(e2e): <short description of what was fixed>

<Longer description if needed explaining:>
- What test was failing
- What the root cause was
- How it was fixed"
```

### Commit Message Convention

Follow the conventional commit format:
- `fix(e2e): fix flaky topology test timeout`
- `fix(e2e): update RBAC page locators after UI redesign`
- `fix(e2e): add retry logic for catalog entity refresh`
- `fix(e2e): skip orchestrator test on GKE platform`

If a Jira ticket exists, reference it:
- `fix(e2e): fix topology locator drift [RHIDP-1234]`

## Step 2: Push to Fork

Push the fix branch to the fork (origin):

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Example:
```bash
git push -u origin fix/e2e-topology-locator
# or
git push -u origin fix/RHIDP-1234-e2e-topology-locator
```

## Step 3: Create Pull Request

Create a PR against the upstream `redhat-developer/rhdh` repository.

**Dynamic username extraction** -- Always derive the GitHub username from the fork remote at runtime rather than hardcoding it. This makes the workflow portable across any contributor's environment:

```bash
GITHUB_USER=$(git remote get-url origin | sed 's|.*github.com[:/]||;s|/.*||')
```

Then create the PR as a **draft** (always use `--draft`):
```bash
gh pr create \
  --draft \
  --repo redhat-developer/rhdh \
  --head "${GITHUB_USER}:<branch-name>" \
  --base <release-branch> \
  --title "fix(e2e): <description> [AI /e2e-fix]" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- <1-2 bullet points explaining what was fixed and why>

## Test Results
- Local verification: 5/5 passes
- Code quality: lint, tsc, prettier all pass

## Related
- Prow job: <URL if applicable>
- Jira: <ticket ID if applicable>
EOF
)"
```

**Important**: Always use `--repo redhat-developer/rhdh` and `--head <username>:<branch>` for cross-fork PRs. Never hardcode the GitHub username -- always extract it dynamically from the origin remote URL so this workflow works for any contributor.

### PR Description Guidelines

Keep it concise:
- What test was failing
- What the root cause was
- How it was fixed
- Link to the original failing CI job or Jira ticket

## Step 4: Trigger Qodo Agentic Review

After the PR is created, trigger an agentic review from Qodo (PR-Agent):

```bash
# Get the PR number from the create output, then comment
gh pr comment <PR-number> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --body "/agentic_review"
```

The Qodo bot will:
1. Analyze the code changes
2. Post review comments with suggestions
3. Optionally approve or request changes

## Step 5: Wait for and Address Qodo Review

### Poll for Review Comments

Poll for Qodo review completion (typically takes 1-3 minutes):

```bash
# Poll for Qodo bot review (check every 15s, up to 20 attempts = 5 min)
for i in $(seq 1 20); do
  REVIEW_STATE=$(gh api repos/redhat-developer/rhdh/pulls/<PR-number>/reviews \
    --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login | test("github-actions|qodo|codium|pr-agent"))] | last | .state // empty')
  if [[ -n "$REVIEW_STATE" ]]; then
    echo "Qodo review received (state: $REVIEW_STATE)"
    break
  fi
  echo "Waiting for Qodo review (attempt $i/20)..."
  sleep 15
done
```

If a review is received, fetch the inline comments:

```bash
# Get inline review comments
gh api repos/redhat-developer/rhdh/pulls/<PR-number>/comments \
  --jq '.[] | select(.user.login | test("github-actions|qodo|codium|pr-agent")) | {path: .path, line: .line, body: .body}'
```

If no review is received after 5 minutes, ask the user for guidance.

### Address Review Comments

For each review comment:

1. **Code suggestions**: If the suggestion improves the code, apply it:
  ```bash
  # Make the change locally
  # Then stage only the changed files and commit
  git add <specific-files>
  git commit -m "fix(e2e): address review feedback"
  git push
  ```
   **Never use `git add -A` or `git add .`** — always stage specific files to avoid committing `.env`, test artifacts, or other local-only files.

2. **Style/convention issues**: Fix them per project conventions

3. **False positives**: If a suggestion is incorrect, explain why in a reply:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/redhat-developer/rhdh/pulls/<PR-number>/comments/<comment-id>/replies \
    -f body="This is intentional because <reason>"
  ```

4. **Questions**: Answer them with context from the codebase

## Step 6: Trigger Affected CI Job

After addressing Qodo review feedback (and pushing any follow-up commits), trigger the presubmit E2E job that corresponds to the originally failing CI job. Presubmit job names differ from periodic/nightly names but cover the same platform and deployment method.

**CRITICAL**: Never guess or construct presubmit job names. Always discover them from the `openshift-ci` bot response as described below.

### Step 6a: Request Available Jobs

Comment `/test ?` on the PR to request the list of available presubmit jobs:

```bash
gh pr comment <PR-number> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --body "/test ?"
```

### Step 6b: Wait for the Bot Response

The bot usually responds within seconds. Poll PR comments for the `openshift-ci` bot's response:

```bash
# Poll for the openshift-ci bot response (check every 5s, up to 12 attempts = 1 min)
for i in $(seq 1 12); do
  BOT_RESPONSE=$(gh api repos/redhat-developer/rhdh/issues/<PR-number>/comments \
    --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login == "openshift-ci[bot]" or .user.login == "openshift-ci-robot")] | last | .body // empty')
  if [[ -n "$BOT_RESPONSE" ]] && echo "$BOT_RESPONSE" | grep -q '/test'; then
    echo "Bot response received:"
    echo "$BOT_RESPONSE"
    break
  fi
  echo "Waiting for openshift-ci bot response (attempt $i/12)..."
  sleep 5
done
```

If no response is received after 1 minute, ask the user for guidance.

### Step 6c: Understand the Bot Response

The bot's response has two sections:

1. **Required jobs** — triggered automatically when the PR is marked as ready for review (not on draft PRs). These run the basic presubmit checks:
  ```
  /test e2e-ocp-helm
  ```
2. **Optional jobs** — must be triggered explicitly. These include nightly variants, other platforms, and operators:
  ```
  /test e2e-ocp-helm-nightly
  /test e2e-eks-helm-nightly
  /test e2e-aks-operator-nightly
  ...
  ```

Note: the job names in the bot's response are **shortened** (e.g., `e2e-ocp-helm`), not the full Prow `pull-ci-redhat-developer-rhdh-...` format. Use these short names directly with `/test`.

### Step 6d: Select and Trigger the Right Job

Match the original failure to the right presubmit job from the bot's list:

| Original failure pattern | Trigger |
|--------------------------|---------|
| `*ocp*helm*nightly*` | `/test e2e-ocp-helm-nightly` |
| `*ocp*operator*nightly*` | `/test e2e-ocp-operator-nightly` |
| `*ocp*v4-19*helm*` | `/test e2e-ocp-v4-19-helm-nightly` |
| `*aks*helm*` | `/test e2e-aks-helm-nightly` |
| `*eks*helm*` | `/test e2e-eks-helm-nightly` |
| `*gke*operator*` | `/test e2e-gke-operator-nightly` |

```bash
gh pr comment <PR-number> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --body "/test <job-name-from-bot-response>"
```

**Rules**:
- **Only use job names that appeared in the bot's response** — never construct or guess names
- The required job (`e2e-ocp-helm`) runs automatically — you usually only need to trigger the optional job matching the original failure
- If no matching job exists in the list, inform the user and ask how to proceed

## Step 7: Monitor CI Status

### Watch CI Checks

After pushing changes, monitor the CI pipeline:

```bash
gh pr checks <PR-number> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --watch
```

Or check manually:
```bash
gh pr checks <PR-number> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh
```

CI check types (Prow E2E jobs, lint checks, build checks, etc.) are documented in the project CI rules. Use `gh pr checks` output to identify which specific check failed.

### If CI Fails

1. **E2E test failure**: Check the Prow job logs, determine if it's the same test or a different one
2. **Lint failure**: Run `yarn lint:fix` locally, commit and push
3. **Build failure**: Check TypeScript errors with `yarn tsc`
4. **Unrelated failure**: Comment on the PR noting it's an unrelated failure, optionally `/retest` to re-trigger

### Re-trigger CI

If a CI check needs to be re-run:
```bash
# For Prow jobs, comment on the PR
gh pr comment <PR-number> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --body "/retest"

# For specific jobs
gh pr comment <PR-number> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --body "/retest <job-name>"
```

## Step 8: Final Status Report

After CI passes (or all issues are addressed), produce a final report:

```
PR Status Report:
- PR: <URL>
- Branch: <branch> -> <release-branch>
- CI Status: PASS / PENDING / FAIL
- Qodo Review: Addressed / Pending
- Files changed: <count>
- Action items: <any remaining items>
```

## Quick Reference: PR Workflow Commands

```bash
# Determine GitHub username from fork remote
GITHUB_USER=$(git remote get-url origin | sed 's|.*github.com[:/]||;s|/.*||')

# Create draft PR (always use --draft)
gh pr create --draft --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --head "${GITHUB_USER}:<branch>" --base <release-branch> --title "fix(e2e): <description> [AI /e2e-fix]"

# Trigger Qodo review
gh pr comment <PR#> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --body "/agentic_review"

# List available presubmit jobs (Step 6a)
gh pr comment <PR#> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --body "/test ?"

# Wait for openshift-ci bot response (Step 6b) -- poll until bot replies with job list

# Trigger specific presubmit job (Step 6d) -- ONLY use a job name from the bot's response
gh pr comment <PR#> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --body "/test <job-name-from-bot-response>"

# Check CI status
gh pr checks <PR#> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh

# Re-trigger tests
gh pr comment <PR#> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --body "/retest"

# View PR
gh pr view <PR#> --repo redhat-developer/rhdh --web
```
