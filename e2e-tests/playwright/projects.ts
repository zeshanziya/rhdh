 * Playwright Project Names - Single Source of Truth

 * The project names are defined in projects.json.
 * This file re-exports them as PW_PROJECT with proper TypeScript types.
 *
 * Used in:
 * - playwright.config.ts for project definitions
 * - CI/CD pipeline scripts (via .ci/pipelines/playwright-projects.sh as PW_PROJECT_*)
 * - package.json scripts for local development
